## Introduction
Welcome to the Sandbox, a repository for me to experiment and tinker around with things I'm interested in. It's meant to be a safe place for me to do things without unexpectedly breaking anything and everything, whether it's simple 'hello, world!' programs or ambitious, full-scale ones.

The world of technology has been quite a ride for me, someone who's just starting. Encountering new technologies and fields of digital tech is always exhilarating, finding a new purpose for everything. Feel free to join me on this journey!

## Contributions
Since this repository is mostly meant to be experimental, I doubt that contributions are *that* helpful. Even so, if you notice anything that can be improved - some tips here and there, corrections, or whatever else useful - please feel free to create an issue!

Thanks for visiting my Sandbox! ðŸ‘‹
