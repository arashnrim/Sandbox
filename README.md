## Introduction
Welcome to the Sandbox, a repository for me to experiment and tinker around with things I'm interested in. It's meant to be a safe place for me to do things without unexpectedly breaking anything and everything, whether it's simple 'hello, world!' programs or ambitious, full-scale ones.

The world of technology has been quite a ride for me, someone who's just starting. Encountering new technologies and fields of digital tech is always exhilarating, finding a new purpose for everything. Feel free to join me on this journey!

## Projects
Here's a list of projects you can find here:

| Project Name |          Description         | Made with |
|:------------:|------------------------------|:---------:|
| [pyweather](https://github.com/arashnrim/Sandbox/tree/pyweather)    | A command-line weather tool. | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python%20-%2314354C.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/> |
| [pyscraper](https://github.com/arashnrim/Sandbox/tree/pyscraper)    | A news article scraping tool. | <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python%20-%2314354C.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/> |

There is also the [Playground](https://github.com/arashnrim/Sandbox/tree/playground), which serves for me to play around and familiarise myself with the syntax of new programming languages I'm checking out.

## Contributions
Since this repository is mostly meant to be experimental, I doubt that contributions are *that* helpful. Even so, if you notice anything that can be improved - some tips here and there, corrections, or whatever else useful - please feel free to create an issue!

Thanks for visiting my Sandbox! ðŸ‘‹
