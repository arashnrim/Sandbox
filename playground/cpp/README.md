# C++

## Compiling and Running

To run a C++ file, you will have to compile it before hand before running it as an executable. In order to compile, you'll be using `g++` as the compiler for C++.

1. Compile your program using `g++`.

```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

> Note that `-o` is the argument for the output file name, and `main` is arbitrary; if you'd like, feel free to name it anything else!

2. Run the compiled program.

```
./main
```

> If you have chosen another name in step 1, make sure to use that instead of `main`.
