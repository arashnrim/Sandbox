# Rust

## Running

To run a Rust file, you will have to compile it before hand before running it as an executable. In order to compile, you'll be using Cargo to help.

0. Install Rust using [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs) and verify that installation is complete.

1. Run the program using `cargo`.

```
cargo run
```
