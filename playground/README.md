## Introduction

Welcome to the Playground! This folder in the Sandbox aims to help me learn programming languages by interacting with them hands-on. By getting to use the languages, compile programs using each language's respective compilers (if necessary), and finding out errors on my own, I think that it's a great way to learn. Not to mention, this also serves as an example of learning in public!

This folder is highly experimental, so you may not see any real-world applications of the programming languages here just yet. Nonetheless, if you're willing enough to take a look at the source code for each language (they should be similar), please feel free to sound out any issues you see — be it code styling issues, tips to improve code, and so on. Your contribution will be greatly appreciated!

## Languages

So far, the languages that I have started playing around with are:

- [C++](https://github.com/arashnrim/Sandbox/tree/main/playground/cpp)
- [Rust](https://github.com/arashnrim/Sandbox/tree/main/playground/rust)

## Contributions and Acknowledgements
As mentioned in the Introduction, this is highly experimental and so I wouldn't expect much contributions. However, if you'd like to leave a tip, point out some errors, or whatever else that may help, feel free to create an Issue!

Special thanks go to the well-written docs that each language has made that makes it much easier for people to begin using them. Thanks to Stack Overflow too, where some questions I have are answered as well. Lastly, thank you for stopping by!
